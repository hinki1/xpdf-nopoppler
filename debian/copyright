 Xpdf is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version
 2.  In my opinion, the GPL is a convoluted, confusing, ambiguous mess.
 But it's also pervasive, and I'm sick of arguing.  And even if it is
 confusing, the basic idea is good.
 .
 In order to cut down on the confusion a little bit, here are some
 informal clarifications:
 .
 - I don't mind if you redistribute xpdf in source and/or binary form,
   as long as you include all of the documentation: README, man pages
   (or help files), and COPYING.  (Note that the README file contains a
   pointer to a web page with the source code.)
 .
 - Selling a CD-ROM that contains xpdf is fine with me, as long as it
   includes the documentation.  I wouldn't mind receiving a sample
   copy, but it's not necessary.
 .
 - If you make useful changes to xpdf, please make the source code
   available -- post it on a web site, email it to me, whatever.
 .
