.SH "NAME"
update\-xpdfrc \- program to generate xpdf's configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B update\-xdfrc
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B \fBupdate\-xpdfrc\fR
is a program used to generate part of the \fIxpdfrc(5)\fR file used 
by xpdf. The generated configuration file contains a list of the
configuration snippets provided by the xpdf-* language packages.

You may edit the file \fI/etc/xpdfrc\fR to configure xpdf.
However, do not edit the generated file \fI/etc/xpdf/includes\fR.
It is updated whenever a language package is added or removed.
You must include the file /etc/xpdf/includes in your xpdfrc
to make use of this functionality.

The language support packages (xpdf-japanese etc) provide additional
configuration files such as \fI/etc/xpdf/xpdfrc-japanese\fR, which will be
listed in the generated \fI/etc/xpdf/includes\fR.

Hidden files such as \fI/etc/xpdf/.svn/*\fR are ignored.
